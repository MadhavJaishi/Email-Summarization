Email Summarization

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on summarizing email content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages transformer-based models to generate concise summaries while maintaining key information from the original email text. The ROUGE metric is used to evaluate the quality of generated summaries.

🚀 Features

Automatic Email Summarization: Converts lengthy email content into short, meaningful summaries.

Transformer-Based Model: Utilizes a pre-trained language model for text summarization.

ROUGE Score Evaluation: Measures the accuracy of generated summaries against reference summaries.

Tokenization & Text Processing: Uses a tokenizer for handling input text efficiently.

🛠️ Technologies Used

📜 How It Works

Tokenize the Email Content:

inputs = tokenizer(test_input, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)

Generate Summary:

summary_ids = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=128, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
generated_summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

Evaluate Using ROUGE Scores:

rouge_scores = rouge.compute(
    predictions=[generated_summary],
    references=[reference_summary]
)

Determine Final Accuracy:

final_accuracy = max(rouge_scores["rouge1"], rouge_scores["rouge2"], rouge_scores["rougeL"])
print(f"Final Accuracy: {final_accuracy:.4f}")

📦 Installation & Usage

🔹 Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies:

pip install torch transformers evaluate

🔹 Run the Summarization Script

python src/summarization.py

📊 Evaluation

The generated summaries are evaluated using ROUGE scores:

ROUGE-1: Measures unigram overlap.

ROUGE-2: Measures bigram overlap.

ROUGE-L: Measures longest common subsequence overlap.
